          Why WebAR? WebAR, or web-based augmented reality, enables
          augmented reality (AR) to work within a browser. WebAR opens up
          new ways to connect with users by engaging them in extraordinary,
          interactive experiences anywhere they are — all with no app
          required.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Massive Reach</h5>
        <p>
          3.5 billion smartphones worldwide across iOS and Android devices
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Creative Freedom</h5>
        <p>
          Harness the freedom and the flexibility of the web with complete
          control of your content, launch schedule, analytics solution and
          more
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">No App Required</h5>
        <p>
          WebAR experiences require no app to download, reducing activation
          energy and barrier to entry to increase engagement with your
          content

          Showcasing the power of 8th Wall + WebAR, Valtech has built a
          demo that highlights some of its core features, including World
          Tracking, Image Targets, and Face Effects.

        <p>
          Spyglass is a 3-week, augmented reality (AR) proof of concept
          (POC) by Valtech and Contentstack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spyglass POC uses AR to help demystify skincare products in a
          retail and home setting. We explain much more in the
          behind-the-scenes blogposts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prototype is very much a proof of concept. You may find some
          things still do not work as you might as expect. Right now, the
          demo has three scenarios, but they are not seamlessly connected
          to each other.
