          Why WebAR? WebAR, or web-based augmented reality, enables
          augmented reality (AR) to work within a browser. WebAR opens up
          new ways to connect with users by engaging them in extraordinary,
          interactive experiences anywhere they are — all with no app
          required.
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Massive Reach</h5>
        <p>
          3.5 billion smartphones worldwide across iOS and Android devices
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Creative Freedom</h5>
        <p>
          Harness the freedom and the flexibility of the web with complete
          control of your content, launch schedule, analytics solution and
          more
        </p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">No App Required</h5>
        <p>
          WebAR experiences require no app to download, reducing activation
          energy and barrier to entry to increase engagement with your
          content

        <h3 class="title">8th Wall Demo</h3>
        <p>
          Showcasing the power of WebAR, Valtech has built an 8th Wall demo
          that highlights some of its core features, including World
          Tracking, Image Targets, and Face Effects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            World Tracking: Create markerless experiences that allow the
            user to place interactive 3D content in their real world
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Image Targets: Allows web apps to instantly detect and track
            any uploaded image on flat and curved surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Face Effects: Render face meshes or anchor 3D objects such as
            glasses or jewelry to a variety of face attachment points.
          </li>
          <li>
            6DoF Positional Tracking: Allows the user to explore their
            space and interact with AR content using only their smartphone
            camera and gyro.
          </li>
          <li>
            Surface Estimation: Allows detection of the ground or other
            flat surfaces such as tables for precise virtual object
            placement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lighting Estimation: Lighting levels in the user’s real world
            can be used to match lighting in an AR scene.
          </li>
          <li>
            World Points: Points in the world can be detected and used by
            an AR experience for visualization.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Spyglass is a 3-week, augmented reality (AR) proof of concept
          (POC) by Valtech and Contentstack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spyglass POC uses AR to help demystify skincare products in a
          retail and home setting. We explain much more in the
          behind-the-scenes blogposts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This prototype is very much a proof of concept. You may find some
          things still do not work as you might as expect. Right now, the
          demo has three scenarios, but they are not seamlessly connected
          to each other.
        </p>
